# Task Management Box
The following code is for programming the Task Management Box for a College Project during my Freshman Year.\
The box allows the user to set a timer for a specific duration using the Keypad and place a phone in a phone cage to avoid distractions.\
This enables the user to focus and complete a greater amount of tasks in a short duration of time.\
The box included different aspects of electronics including:\
Arduino \
A servo motor \
An LCD Screen \
A keypad with numbers from 0-9, A-D, #,$\
